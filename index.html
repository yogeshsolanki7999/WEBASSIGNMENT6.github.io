    <hr>

    <p>Renowned curator Jacques Sauniere staggered through the vaulted archway of the museum's <br>
         Grand Gallery. He lunged for the nearest painting he could see, a Caravaggio. Grabbing the gilded frame, <br>
          the seventy-six-year-old man heaved the masterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wall and <br> 
          Sauniere collapsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas.</p>


    <p>As he had anticipated, a thundering iron gate fell nearby, barricading the entrance to the suite. The <br>
         parquet floor shook. Far off, an alarm began to ring.</p>

    <p>The curator lay a moment, gasping for breath, taking stock. I am still alive.He crawled out from under <br>
        the canvas and scanned the cavernous space for someplace to hide.</p>


    <p>A voice spoke, chillingly close. "Do not move."</p>


    <p>On his hands and knees, the curator froze, turning his head slowly.</p>


    <p>Only fifteen feet away, outside the sealed gate, the mountainous silhouette of his attacker stared <br> 
        through the iron bars. He was broad and tall, with ghost-pale skin and thinning white hair. His irises <br>
         were pink with dark red pupils. The albino drew a pistol from his coat and aimed the barrel through <br>
          the bars, directly at the curator. "You should not have run." His accent was not easy to place. "Now tell  me <br> where it is."</p>


    <p>"I told you already," the curator stammered, kneeling defenseless on the floor of the gallery. "I have no <br>
         idea what you are talking about!"</p>


    <p>"You are lying." The man stared at him, perfectly immobile except for the glint in his ghostly eyes. "You <br>
         and your brethren possess something that is not yours."</p>


    <p>The curator felt a surge of adrenaline. How could he possibly know this?</p>


    <p>"Tonight the rightful guardians will be restored. Tell me where it is hidden, and you will live." The man <br>
         leveled his gun at the curator's head. "Is it a secret you will die for?"</p>


    <p>Sauniere could not breathe.</p>


    <p>The man tilted his head, peering down the barrel of his gun.</p>


    <p>Sauniere held up his hands in defense. "Wait," he said slowly. "I will tell you what you need to know."</p>


    <p>The curator spoke his next words carefully. The lie he told was one he had rehearsed many times... <br>
         each time praying he would never have to use it.</p>


    <p>When the curator had finished speaking, his assailant smiled smugly. "Yes. This is exactly what the <br>
         others told me."

    </p>


    <p>Sauniere recoiled. The others?</p>


    <p>"I found them, too," the huge man taunted. "All three of them. They confirmed what you have just said."</p>


    <p>It cannot be! The curator's true identity, along with the identities of his three senechaux, was almost <br>
         as sacred as the ancient secret they protected. Sauniere now realized his senechaux, following strict <br>
          procedure, had told the same lie before their own deaths. It was part of the protocol.</p>


    <p>The attacker aimed his gun again. "When you are gone, I will be the only one who knows the truth."</p>


    <p>The truth.In an instant, the curator grasped the true horror of the situation. If I die, the truth will be lost <br>
         forever.Instinctively, he tried to scramble for cover.</p>

         
         
         <p>The gun roared, and the curator felt a searing heat as the bullet lodged in his stomach. He fell <br>
             forward... struggling against the pain. Slowly, Sauniere rolled over and stared back through the bars <br>
              at his attacker.</p>
         
         
         <p>The man was now taking dead aim at Sauniere's head.</p>
         
         
         <p>Sauniere closed his eyes, his thoughts a swirling tempest of fear and regret. The click of an empty <br>
             chamber echoed through the corridor. The curator's eyes flew open.</p>
         
         
         <p>The man glanced down at his weapon, looking almost amused. He reached for a second clip, but then <br>
             seemed to reconsider, smirking calmly at Sauniere's gut. "My work here is done."</p>
         
         
         <p>The curator looked down and saw the bullet hole in his white linen shirt. It was framed by a small circle <br>
             of blood a few inches below his breastbone. My stomach.Almost cruelly, the bullet had missed his <br>
              heart. As a veteran of la Guerre d'Algerie, the curator had witnessed this horribly drawn-out death <br>
               before. For fifteen minutes, he would survive as his stomach acids seeped into his chest cavity, <br>
                slowly poisoning him from within.</p>
         
         
         <p>"Pain is good, monsieur," the man said. Then he was gone. Alone now, Jacques Sauniere turned his <br> gaze again to the iron gate. He was trapped, and the doors could not be reopened for at least twenty <br>
             minutes. By the time anyone got to him, he would be dead. Even so, the fear that now gripped him was <br>
              a fear far greater than that of his own death.</p>
         
         
         <p>I must pass on the secret.</p>
         
         
         <p>Staggering to his feet, he pictured his three murdered brethren. He thought of the generations who <br>
             had come before them... of the mission with which they had all been entrusted.</p>
         
         
         <p>An unbroken chain of knowledge.</p>
         
         
         <p>Suddenly, now, despite all the precautions... despite all the fail-safes... Jacques Sauniere was the only <br>
             remaining link, the sole guardian of one of the most powerful secrets ever kept.</p>
         
         
         <p>Shivering, he pulled himself to his feet.</p>
         
         
         <p>I must find some way... .</p>
         
         
         <p>He was trapped inside the Grand Gallery, and there existed only one person on earth to whom he <br>
             could pass the torch. Sauniere gazed up at the walls of his opulent prison. A collection of the world's <br> most famous paintings seemed to smile down on him like old friends.</p>
         
         
         <p>ing in pain, he summoned all of his faculties and strength. The desperate task before him, he <br>
             knew, would require every remaining second of his life.</p>
