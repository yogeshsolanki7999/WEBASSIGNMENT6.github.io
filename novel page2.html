    <hr>

    <p>Robert Langdon awoke slowly.</p>

    <p>A telephone was ringing in the darkness - a tinny, unfamiliar ring. He fumbled for the bedside lamp and <br>
         turned it on. Squinting at his surroundings he saw a plush Renaissance bedroom with Louis XVI <br>
          furniture, hand-frescoed walls, and a colossal mahogany four-poster bed.</p>
    
    
    <p>Where the hell am I?</p>
    
    
    <p>The jacquard bathrobe hanging on his bedpost bore the monogram: HOTEL RITZ PARIS.</p>
    
    
    <p>Slowly, the fog began to lift.</p>
    
    
    <p>Langdon picked up the receiver. "Hello?"</p>
    
    
    <p>"Monsieur Langdon?" a man's voice said. "I hope I have not awoken you?"</p>
    
    
    <p>Dazed, Langdon looked at the bedside clock. It was 12:32 A. M. He had been asleep only an hour, but <br>
         he felt like the dead.</p>
    
    
    <p>"This is the concierge, monsieur. I apologize for this intrusion, but you have a visitor. He insists it is <br>
         urgent."</p>
    
    
    <p>Langdon still felt fuzzy. A visitor? His eyes focused now on a crumpled flyer on his bedside table.</p>
    
    
    <p>THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF PARIS</p>
    
    
    <p>proudly presents</p>
    
    
    <p>AN EVENING WITH ROBERT LANGDON</p>
    
    
    <p>PROFESSOR OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLOGY, HARVARD UNIVERSITY</p>
    
    
    <p>Langdon groaned. Tonight's lecture - a slide show about pagan symbolism hidden in the stones of <br>
         Chartres Cathedral - had probably ruffled some conservative feathers in the audience. Most likely, <br>
          some religious scholar had trailed him home to pick a fight. "I'm sorry," Langdon said, "but I'm very <br>
           tired and - " "Mais, monsieur,"the concierge pressed, lowering his voice to an urgent whisper. "Your <br>
            guest is an important man."</p>
    
    
    <p>Langdon had little doubt. His books on religious paintings and cult symbology had made him a <br>
         reluctant celebrity in the art world, and last year Langdon's visibility had increased a hundred fold after <br>
          his involvement in a widely publicized incident at the Vatican. Since then, the stream of self- important <br>
           historians and art buffs arriving at his door had seemed never-ending.</p>
    
    
    <p>"If you would be so kind," Langdon said, doing his best to remain polite," could you take the man's <br>
         name and number, and tell him I'll try to call him before I leave Paris on Tuesday? Thank you." He <br>
          hung up before the concierge could protest.</p>
    
    
    <p>Sitting up now, Langdon frowned at his bedside Guest Relations Handbook, whose cover boasted <br>
        :  SLEEP LIKE A BABY IN THE CITY OF LIGHTS. SLUMBER AT THE PARIS RITZ. He turned <br>
         and gazed tiredly into the full-length mirror across the room. The man staring back at him was a stranger <br>
          - tousled and weary.</p>
    
    
    <p>You need a vacation, Robert.</p>
    
    
    <p>The past year had taken a heavy toll on him, but he didn't appreciate seeing proof in the mirror. His <br>
         usually sharp blue eyes looked hazy and drawn tonight. A dark stubble was shrouding his strong jaw <br>
          and dimpled chin. Around his temples, the gray highlights were advancing, making their way deeper <br>
           into his thicket of coarse black hair. Although his female colleagues insisted the gray only accentuated <br>
         his bookish appeal, Langdon knew better.</p>
    
    
    <p>If Boston Magazine could see me now.</p>
    
    
    <p>Last month, much to Langdon's embarrassment, Boston Magazine had listed him as one of that city's <br> top ten most intriguing people - a dubious honor that made him the brunt of endless ribbing by his <br>
         Harvard colleagues. Tonight, three thousand miles from home, the accolade had resurfaced to haunt <br>
          him at the lecture he had given.</p>
    
    
    <p>"Ladies and gentlemen..." the hostess had announced to a full house at the American University of <br>
         Paris's Pavilion Dauphine," Our guest tonight needs no introduction. He is the author of numerous <br>
          books: The Symbology of Secret Sects, The An of the Illuminati, The Lost Language of Ideograms, <br>
           and when I say he wrote the book on Religious Iconology, I mean that quite literally. Many of you use <br>
            his textbooks in class."</p>
    
    
    <p>The students in the crowd nodded enthusiastically.</p>
    
    
    <p>"I had planned to introduce him tonight by sharing his impressive curriculum vitae. However..." She <br>
         glanced playfully at Langdon, who was seated onstage. "An audience member has just handed me <br>
          a far more, shall we say... intriguing introduction." She held up a copy of Boston Magazine. Langdon <br>
           cringed. Where the hell did she get that?</p>
    
    
    <p>The hostess began reading choice excerpts from the inane article, and Langdon felt himself sinking <br>
         lower and lower in his chair. Thirty seconds later, the crowd was grinning, and the woman showed no <br>
          signs of letting up. "And Mr. Langdon's refusal to speak publicly about his unusual role in last year's <br>
           Vatican conclave certainly wins him points on our intrigue-o-meter." The hostess goaded the crowd. <br>
            "Would you like to hear more?"</p>
    
    
    <p>The crowd applauded.</p>
    
    
    <p>Somebody stop her, Langdon pleaded as she dove into the article again.</p>
    
    
    <p>"Although Professor Langdon might not be considered hunk-handsome like some of our younger <br>
         awardees, this forty-something academic has more than his share of scholarly allure. His captivating <br>
          presence is punctuated by an unusually low, baritone speaking voice, which his female students <br>
           describe as 'chocolate for the ears.'</p>
    
    
    <p>The hall erupted in laughter.</p>
    
    
    <p>Langdon forced an awkward smile. He knew what came next - some ridiculous line about" Harrison <br>
         Ford in Harris tweed" - and because this evening he had figured it was finally safe again to wear his <br>
          Harris tweed and Burberry turtleneck, he decided to take action.</p>
    
    
    <p>"Thank you, Monique," Langdon said, standing prematurely and edging her away from the podium. <br>
         "Boston Magazine clearly has a gift for fiction." He turned to the audience with an embarrassed sigh. <br>
          "And if I find which one of you provided that article, I'll have the consulate deport you."</p>
    
    
    <p>The crowd laughed.</p>
    
    
    <p>"Well, folks, as you all know, I'm here tonight to talk about the power of symbols ..."</p>
    
    
    <p>The ringing of Langdon's hotel phone once again broke the silence.</p>
    
    
    <p>Groaning in disbelief, he picked up. "Yes?"</p>
    
    
    <p>As expected, it was the concierge. "Mr. Langdon, again my apologies. I am calling to inform you that <br>
         your guest is now en route to your room. I thought I should alert you."</p>
    
    
    <p>Langdon was wide awake now. "You sent someone to my room?"</p>
    
    
    <p>"I apologize, monsieur, but a man like this... I cannot presume the authority to stop him." "Who exactly <br>
         is he?" But the concierge was gone.</p>
    
    
    <p>Almost immediately, a heavy fist pounded on Langdon's door.</p>
    
    
    <p>Uncertain, Langdon slid off the bed, feeling his toes sink deep into the savonniere carpet. He donned <br>
         the hotel bathrobe and moved toward the door. "Who is it?"</p>
    
    
    <p>"Mr. Langdon? I need to speak with you." The man's English was accented - a sharp, authoritative <br>
         bark. "My name is Lieutenant Jerome Collet. Direction Centrale Police Judiciaire."</p>
    
    
    <p>Langdon paused. The Judicial Police? The DCPJ was the rough equivalent of the U. S. FBI.</p>
    
    
    <p>Leaving the security chain in place, Langdon opened the door a few inches. The face staring back at <br>
         him was thin and washed out. The man was exceptionally lean, dressed in an official-looking blue <br>
          uniform.</p>
    
    
    <p>"May I come in?" the agent asked.</p>
    
    
    <p>Langdon hesitated, feeling uncertain as the stranger's sallow eyes studied him. "What is this all <br> about?"</p>
    
    
    <p>"My capitaine requires your expertise in a private matter." "Now?" Langdon managed. "It's after <br>
         midnight." "Am I correct that you were scheduled to meet with the curator of the Louvre this evening?"</p>
    
    
    <p>Langdon felt a sudden surge of uneasiness. He and the revered curator Jacques Sauniere had been <br> slated to meet for drinks after Langdon's lecture tonight, but Sauniere had never shown up. "Yes. How <br>
         did you know that?"</p>
    
    
    <p>"We found your name in his daily planner."</p>
    
    
    <p style="border: 1px solid black ;">WRITE PF THIS NOVEL IS "YOGESH SOLANKI"</p>
    
    
    <p>"I trust nothing is wrong?"</p>
    
    
    <p>The agent gave a dire sigh and slid a Polaroid snapshot through the narrow opening in the door. <br>
         When Langdon saw the photo, his entire body went rigid." This photo was taken less than an hour <br>
          ago. Inside the Louvre."

    </p>
    
    
    <p>As Langdon stared at the bizarre image, his initial revulsion and shock gave way to a sudden <br>
         upwelling of anger. "Who would do this!"

    </p>
    
    
    <p>"We had hoped that you might help us answer that very question, considering your knowledge in <br>
         symbology and your plans to meet with him."

    </p>
    
    
    <p>Langdon stared at the picture, his horror now laced with fear. The image was gruesome and <br>
         profoundly strange, bringing with it an unsettling sense of deja vu. A little over a year ago, Langdon <br>
          had received a photograph of a corpse and a similar request for help. Twenty-four hours later, he had <br>
           almost lost his life inside Vatican City. This photo was entirely different, and yet something about the <br>
            scenario felt disquietingly familiar.

    </p>
    
    
    <p>The agent checked his watch. "My capitaine is waiting, sir."

    </p>
    
    
    <p>Langdon barely heard him. His eyes were still riveted on the picture. "This symbol here, and the way <br>
         his body is so oddly..."

    </p>
    
    
    <p>"Positioned?" the agent offered.

    </p>
    
    
    <p></p>
    
    
    <p>Langdon nodded, feeling a chill as he looked up. "I can't imagine who would do this to someone."

    </p>
    
    
    <p>The agent looked grim. "You don't understand, Mr. Langdon. What you see in this photograph..." He <br>
         paused. "Monsieur Sauniere did that to himself."

    </p>
